    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <article>
      <p>
      I’m a software engineer, passionate about distrubuted systems.
      I have a good understanding and experience with microservice architecture and event sourcing pattern.
      My "<a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring technology</a>" choices are Go, Redis/Valkey and PostgreSQL, although I like to try out new tools and ideas as well.
      </p>

      <p>
      I live in Berlin, Germany. I speak English, Polish and basic German.

      <p>
      Being part of the team that built the next generation car charging device, I was leading the backend design and implementation.
      Initially the project was built around gRPC, and later due to new requirements I have updated the implementation to use the Open Charge Point Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
      In order to accomodate increasing traffic on the legacy Node.js implementaion, I was tasked with designing a new backend which I then also implemented in Go.
      The new backend allows to dynamically increase the limit of connected devices, provides high availability and reliability, and allows for faster development.
      My responsibilities included choosing the most suitable technologies, hosting platform, deciding how to manage our infrastructure and how to test, deploy, run and monitor our applications.

      I was working on the Tendermint framework <a href="https://github.com/iov-one/weave">weave</a>, a competitor to the Cosmos SDK for the Go language,
      that was taking a fresh and unique approach to processing events and maintaining blockchain.
      In parallel to building the weave framework, I was contributing to applications based on that framework.

      Joining Opinary in its early stage, I was trusted with understanding and rewriting the existing proof of concept Python application.
      The new architecture and implementation allowed the company to cut costs and handle an order of magnitude more traffic.
      This change allowed migrating the application from a toy implementation to a product capable of handling HTTP traffic coming from major German newspaper news publisher sites.

      <p>
      As part of extending our functionality, I helped design and implement pipelines for our machine learning and automation services.

      Because we decided to use Go and Docker containers running on CoreOS, that at the time provided incomplete tooling,
      we also developed our own infrastructure for managing our application.

      Our application was gathering mobile devices signal from access points deployed in various shopping centers across Germany. Collected data allowed us to determine location and movement of shoppers and optimize store operations.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition to maintaining the existing application,
      to accommodate the increasing traffic, I have migrated the existing data aggregation and analysis implementation from Python to PL/pgSQL.
      This included adding data partitioning and writing test framework to review PL/pgSQL code.
      Changes allowed to scale the platform to processing hundreds of millions of data points every day.

      I was working on Tagasauris project - an application that collects and creates various metadata for given set of media objects (photo, audio, video).
      The crucial part of the system was a custom implementation of an offline task manager with Amazon SQS as one of the engines.
      Another important component of the application was an high performance counter server implemented using gevent library.
